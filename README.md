# End-to-End DevSecOps Pipeline

This repository showcases a complete, security-focused DevSecOps CI/CD pipeline built around a simple Node.js application.

> The focus of this project is DevSecOps architecture, security tooling, and pipeline design — not application complexity.

Documentation and implementation details will be added step by step.
